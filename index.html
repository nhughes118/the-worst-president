<p id="main-text">We all know James Polk. Ok, let's be real: probably none of us knows James Polk at all. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Governor of Tennessee, and the 11th President of the United States, in his day (the mid-1800s) he was well known. But what did he accomplish? Why should we remember him? Were his accomplishments good, or...not so good? You decide!</p>

<div class="accomplishments">
	<ul>
		<li>Polk achieved a sweeping victory in the Mexicanâ€“American War, which resulted in the cession by Mexico of nearly all the American Southwest. Seems good, right? Depends on your view of war and the United States grabbing more and more territory until it controlled everything from east to west. </li>

		<li>Unlike many of his peers, he never challenged anyone to a duel no matter how much they insulted his honor. Woo hoo, he wasn't a total idiot! But just when you think he was good...as the Speaker of the House, he strongly enforced the "gag rule", by which the House of Representatives would not accept or debate citizen petitions regarding slavery. What?!?!?!</li>

		<span class="good-bad"><button class="bad-president">Bad</button></span>
		<li>We all know that politicians make a lot of promises to get elected or to stay in power. When Polk became President, he focused on 4 key accomplishments, two economic and two expantionist. During his one term as President, he achieved all four. Simple. Effective. Did exactly what he said he was going to do. Boom!</li>
