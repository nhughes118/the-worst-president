<p>We all know James Polk. Ok, let's be real: probably none of us knows James Polk at all. Speaker of the House of Representatives, Governor of Tennessee, and the 11th President of the United States, in his day (the mid-1800s) he was well known. But what did he accomplish? Why should we remember him? Were his accomplishments good, or...not so good? You decide!</p>
